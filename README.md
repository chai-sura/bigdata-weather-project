# bigdata-weather-project

In this project I am addressed weather forecasting with Machine Learning and Big Data tools, in order to show whether is possible to make valuable predictions of meteorological conditions only based on previously seen meteorological data. 
The classification goal is given a set of weather measurements, to predict which meteorological condition should occur.
And later compared with the OpenWeather API using the API token.
